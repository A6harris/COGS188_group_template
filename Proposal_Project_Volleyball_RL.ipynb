    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to train multiple AI agents to complete a volleyball game using various reinforcement learning techniques. We are still deciding between using a 3D volleyball environment using Unity's ML-agents toolkit or a 2D using OpenAI's gymnasium. If we use a 2 dimensional enviornment we will likely attempt multiple learning techniques such as Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo methods, and potentially use neural networks such as Deep Q networks. Our main measurement for success will be how long it takes the agents to learn to play a game of volleyball. We are also considering attempting to have agents trained on different reinforcement learning algorithms compete against eachother in a game of volleyball to see which one performs better. We are not using a specific dataset, however we will keep logs of states, actions, and rewards that the agents use to better understand how the methods compare to one another. "

Additionally, we will analyze performance across different training scenarios to identify and mitigate any emerging biases.\n",
