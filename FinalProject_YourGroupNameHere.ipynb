    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to compare the performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms at playing slime volleyball - a 2 dimensional volleyball game in which the objective is to get the ball to land on the opponents side of the net. To train our agents, we used the SlimeVolleyballGym environment which allowed us to test the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and have different agents play against eachother. This environment has a simple reward structure: the agent recieves +1 if the ball lands on the opponents side of the net, and -1 if it lands on the agent's side. To compare the performance of our algorithms, we will focus on the average reward that they receive over 1000 episodes against the baseline model defined in the environment, and also we will see the average reward that they receive when competing against one another. Each episode has a maximum score of 5 as it ends once one of the agents wins 5 rounds. "

    "\n",
    "For our background, we wanted to do more research into some of the algorithms discussed in class, as well as other potential approaches we wanted to attempt for this problem. Since this repository already has explanations and implementations of a few reinforcement learning algorithms, we wanted to focus on technqiues not already implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DQN\n",
    "Deep Q-Learning bypasses the need for a q-table that the agent can refer to to maximize its future rewards which can be extremely difficult to implement when the environment is large. Instead, it uses a deep neural network to approximate q-values. Since the SlimeVolley environment uses a continuous space with 12-dimensional features, keeping track of a q-table for this task is almost impossible, so using a Deep Q-Network seems like a reasonable approach. Deep Q-Networks were initially proposed by researched at Google DeepMind in 2013 in a paper titled *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning* by Mnih et. al. The goal of this paper is to combine deep learning methods with traditional reinforcement learning strategies such as Q-Learning to develop an algorithm that can successfully learn how to play Atari games using pixelized images as inputs. They key difference between their approach and previous work is that they use a technique known as *experience replay* in which they keep a pool of the agent's past experiences and then randomly draw experiences from this pool to use for Q-Learning updates using an epsilon greedy policy. Although our environment doesn't use pixelized images, we still feel that this strategy will translate well to our agent learning optimal volleyball strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also explored more recent advancements to the DQN that have been shown to various improvements. Double Q-Learning first introduced by Google DeepMind in the paper *Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning* by van Hasselt et al, addresses the issue that the DQN algorithm has a tendencey to overestimate q-values in some games. It extends the idea of Double Q-learning, which was first introduced in the tabular setting to the DQN algorithm. Since Deep Q-Networks rely on a pool of past experiences that were themselves estimated, the epsilon greedy policy **maybe talk about this more if i actually use it*"

    "Our first implementation of the DQN algorithm was very simple. We discretized all possible actions, and used a four layer neural network to estimate q-values. It followed very closely to what we did for the cartpole balance task in assignment four. Even with such a basic architecture, it was able to beat the baseline model a few times. A few issues that we quickly noticed were that we didn't need to include all of the actions, since a few possible options such as going left and right at the same time were likely not going to be useful in this environment. Additionally, we noticed that the epsilon decay rate may have been a bit too aggressive, as early on it didn't seem like the agent was exploring many different actions as for the first few hundred iterations, it made almost no progress at all. The reward function that the environment uses by default was also a bit sparse as the agent only receives positive or negative rewards after the ball hits the ground, which doesn't encourage potentially positive actions such as hitting the ball over the net. However, to keep our benchmarks the same across the different algorithms, we decided that it would be best to keep it this way. \n",
